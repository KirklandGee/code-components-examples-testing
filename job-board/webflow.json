    "description": "A dynamic job board component that fetches and displays open positions from the Greenhouse API. Features a grid layout of job cards, each showing the job title, department, location, and an apply link. Includes interactive department and location filter dropdowns at the top, a loading spinner during data fetch, an error state for failed API calls, and an empty state when no jobs match filters. Supports pagination with a 'Load More' button for large job lists. Cards display in a multi-column grid on desktop and stack vertically on mobile devices. The component connects to any Greenhouse account via a board token prop and handles all API communication, error handling, and responsive layout transitions automatically.",
