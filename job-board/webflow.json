    "description": "A comprehensive job board component that integrates with the Greenhouse API to display open positions in a responsive grid layout. Each job card shows the title, department, location, and an apply link. Features include department and location filter dropdowns at the top, a loading spinner during data fetch, error state messaging for failed API calls, and an empty state when no jobs match the filters. Supports pagination with a 'Load More' button for large job sets. Cards display in a multi-column grid on desktop and stack vertically on mobile devices. The component fetches data from boards-api.greenhouse.io using a configurable board token prop.",
