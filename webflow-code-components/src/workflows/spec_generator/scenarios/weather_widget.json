Displays the current temperature, weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), humidity percentage, wind speed, and a weather icon. Shows a loading state while fetching and an error message if the API key is invalid or the city is not found. Supports Fahrenheit/Celsius toggle. Includes a 'last updated' timestamp and a refresh button to re-fetch data. Clean card-style design.",
