The component supports two layout variants: left-aligned (content positioned to the left side) and centered (content centered on the page). The background image can be toggled on or off, with a subtle overlay to ensure text readability. The CTA button includes hover states and transitions. On mobile devices, the layout automatically adjusts to center-aligned for optimal readability regardless of the selected variant.",
