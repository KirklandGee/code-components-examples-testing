    "description": "A vertically stacked accordion component designed for FAQ sections with 5-6 collapsible items. Each item displays a question header with an expand/collapse icon that rotates on interaction. Clicking a question smoothly expands its answer panel with a slide-down animation while automatically collapsing any previously open item, ensuring only one answer is visible at a time. The active item is visually distinguished with an accent color. Fully responsive and keyboard accessible.",
